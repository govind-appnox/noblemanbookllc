            <h2>Grappling with Mortality</h2>
            <p> Science may tell you that you are nothing more than a mass of protons. Religion may tell you that you are nothing more than some one's servant. I have a different idea of why we are here.

    What are we doing here?

    Where did we come from?

    Are we supposed to be doing something?

    I mean really, why am I here? Why are you here? Why are we here? You have asked yourself these questions before. We all have. It leaves us a little disoriented. Everyone will ask these questions sooner or later in life, usually sooner. And with no definite answer, these feelings of disorientation just linger.

    Being here and alive. What could it be? What could it mean? Could it be as simple as a desire to be here? Did we have to work to get here?  Did you have to pay to be here right now? If so, how much? Are you getting your money's worth?

    We all feel it-that feeling that we are all a part of something bigger than ourselves, yet we have no logical explanation for it. How then is it possible, that sometimes, at the same time, we can feel so all alone. Is life a game, is it a test, a reward, is it earned, is it given? What is life and why are we here? We see death around us every day. Be it the dead carcass of a bug, a withered plant, a disposable item that provided us with something meaningful just moments earlier and has now reached the end of its usefulness. Another human and loved one that is alive one minute and gone the next, leaving our simple human mind in a state that we can never really understand. This ending is simply unfathomable to the human mind. Yet somehow, we go on to live. Even though other people, and things we have shared so much life with, and have been so close to, are no longer with us.

    How is it possible that when something around us ceases to exist, we don't simply give up and go with it? Why don't we refuse to go on living when something that close has gone somewhere else, and we perceive in our minds as somewhere better? Why would we not simply follow, as this seems to be the simplest and most logical thing to do? Is it just our strong will to survive?

    When we have feelings for something we care about, and that something comes to an end, we contemplate, or grapple if you will, with our own mortality. Our own mortality is tested all the time. Yet somehow. We go on.   Somewhere deep inside, we feel and think we know, that even as this very body we are living in will cease to exist, some essence of it will continue on. Somewhere. Somehow. Otherwise, what would be the point. Just to be here and now, trying to enjoy what human life has to offer? Are we truly free, because of the lack of knowledge? Or do our feelings, emotions, thoughts, dreams, visions and ideas, guide us and haunt us into the right direction, thereby restricting our freedom. What is that direction and what made that direction? Did we make our own? Is this how we define that something else is out there? Just because of our feelings and lack of knowledge? Or is this something we tell ourselves just because we desperately need some kind of hope as we cannot accept that when we are gone from what we now know ourselves to be there is nothing else. Is this the best we can formulate on our own? Is this why we convince ourselves that whatever it is that we are doing has some relevance we do not understand but we need to keep doing it anyway? Or are these feelings and thoughts about our own mortality, just an instinctual will to survive, evolved to keep us from using a logical mind that would simply end ourselves when living gets too difficult to understand. We have no every day, interactive proof of anything else. Does this give us a chance to do whatever we want, because of the lack of well known, proven, factual, interactive, everyday knowledge of something else? Can we do whatever we want? Or are we held back by thoughts and feelings, or hauntings of guilt. Whatever we come up with, we will all Grapple with our own Mortality.

            <h2>Platinum</h2>
            <p>Also coming soon is the revised edition of the book 'Platinum' by Sky Nobleman.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Mike was a small town guy and not known well by many. That didn't bother Mike, for he needed all the time to himself he could get. Intrigued by life and all the things that were stuck in his head, Mike had kept busy since early childhood creating and modifying things.
     His parents accepted Mike for who he was since he was their only child. They didn't understand most of what Mike did or was capable of doing. Although they loved him dearly, they couldn't spend much time with him as they were consumed with all the rigmarole of life that can find people even in a small town and envelop all their free time. In fact, they hadn't realized just how intelligent their son really was.  
     When Mike was 14 he had built an 'anti static remoiler', or so he called it. It was a device that would reverse the static charge of, say, a balloon rubbed on one's hair, or the static from clothes in a dryer. Mike could harness this static with his remoiler and store the energy indefinitely in another invention he had made, an 'energy suspension cube', which could be used much like a battery.
     He was always tinkering and seemed to create a new invention as soon as he would finish one. Some would say Mike was a genius and had insight that most people do not, the kind of foresight that one could not obtain in a single lifetime.
     Indeed he was a genius, and that is how he came to find the most life altering thing on this planet. This object was so fascinating it would make any God-fearing person look at their faith in a new light, any fanatic would begin to feel justified, any scientist would feel absolutely overwhelmed and this object would make an atheist reconsider his beliefs.
      Mike had unknowingly found something that would introduce mankind to its true ancestors, and more..."</p>
